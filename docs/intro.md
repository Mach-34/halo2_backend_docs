# Introduction

These docs serve two purposes:
1. Demonstrating the use of the Halo2 Backend in Aztec Noir
2. Providing clarity on adding a new backend to the Aztec Noir DSL

# Getting help

You can join the [Noir Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/VgdzaDyffT) to get general help with the Aztec Noir DSL. This is the easiest way to get quick help with Noir. You can directly tag `jp4g#1337` in the Noir discord for assistance from one of the Halo2 Backend maintainers.


Additionally, you can use the [Aztec Discourse Forum](https://discourse.aztec.network) for longer form questions that involve more of the Aztec stack. While the discord is great for Noir-specific questions, you will find that questions involving the cryptography or engineering of the larget Aztec stack are best answered here.
